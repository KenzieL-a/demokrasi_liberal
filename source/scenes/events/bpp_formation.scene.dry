= A Coalition of Nationalist Parties?

After the fall of the <span style="color: #000000;">Natsir</span> cabinet, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**PKI**</span> has been advocating for a broad nationalist cabinet with the exclusion of the <span style="color: #000000;">**Masyumi**</span>. This hypothetical cabinet will be led by the <span style="color: #990000;">**PNI**</span> consisting of the various smaller nationalist parties, with the toleration or even the participation of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**PKI**</span>. Thus a meeting was held, attended by the <span style="color: #c00000;">**PKI**</span> and other political parties, notably the <span style="color: #003319;">**PSII**</span>, the <span style="color: #FF3333;">**Murba**</span> party, the <span style="color: #FF6666;">**Labour**</span> party, and the <span style="color: #FFCC99;">**Parindra**</span>, to discuss the possibility of such a proposition. 

- @form: The BPP is formed.

The meeting has resulted in the formation of the <span class="tooltip-text" title="Consultative Body of Parties">BPP</span>, a confederative association of political parties consisting of the meeting's atendees. These parties are loosely joined together on the basis of a broadly nationalist Common Program which called for a "truly independent foreign policy", freedom from the Round Table Conference Agreement, the return of West Irian to Indonesia, mass nationalizations and industrializations, and a "just distribution of land to peasants".

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**PKI**</span> leadership has approached us and invited the <span style="color: #990000;">**PNI**</span> to join this proposition. However, if we are to join this coalition, the <span style="color: #000000;">**Masyumi**</span> might take this move as a sign of us opposing and distancing away from them.

- @join: Our negotiation with the <span style="color: #000000;">**Masyumi**</span> is going no where, join the BPP.
- @no-join: We need to reconciliate with the <span style="color: #000000;">**Masyumi**</span> to form a truly "broad" cabinet.
